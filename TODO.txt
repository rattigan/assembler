Graph of export and import objects
Each module has an export and and import object (which may be empty)
Step 1 - determine dependencies between components (based on annotations on import and export objects)
Step 2 start components that have no dependencies
Step 3 each time a component starts up, create a child injector containing all the exported objects as bindings
Step 4 remove started components and go to step 2

problems:
1, how to determine dependencies?
2, can child modules export additional bindings for the same type? (e.g. for multibindings)
Elements

Maybe PrivateModules can be used for this.

Each component exposes a set of shared objects


1. There is a set of import objects that guice can inject
2. If these are in some parent module, with all components in a child module




<Component, Key, Binding>
Merge all exposes bindings


Create Component
Get module
- bind must bind add provider bindings for all injected fields of the Component
